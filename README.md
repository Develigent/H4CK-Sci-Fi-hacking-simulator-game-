# H4CK-Sci-Fi-hacking-simulator-game-

I developed an adventure game that simulates hacking through a computer terminal set in a cybercity, 
where players access information about a company by inputting the correct credentials through 
navigating the terminal; I created and textured the 3D assets (except the character) using Blender, 
Photoshop, and Substance Painter, designed the UI/UX in Photoshop, coded the game using Visual Studio 2019, 
and built it in Unity with the Universal Render Pipeline, making it accessible to play in WebGL on itch.io.
